PERSONAL SUMMARY
==============================
I am an agroecosystem and landscape modeler committed to leveraging scientific knowledge to contribute to sustainable and effective natural resource management.
I am interested in using big data and models through advanced computer programming to guide decision-making and bolster environmental sustainability. I am competent in GIS, multi-objective optimization, point-process modeling, process-based modeling, and API programming.

My modeling-based research is paramount in understanding agroecosystem landscapes, as their multifaceted functions are integral to human prosperity. These landscapes are characterized by profound complexity, pervasive uncertainty, and intensive human demands, necessitating a transformative approach to land use decision-making. I aim to navigate and simplify this complexity, enabling informed and strategic land use management by applying rigorous scientific research supported by advanced modeling techniques.
