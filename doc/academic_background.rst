Educational Background
======================

2021-2023
    - Certification in Data-Driven Food, Energy, and Water Decision Making, Iowa State University, Ames, USA.

2021 to Present
    - Forestry PhD Graduate, Iowa State University, Department of Natural Resource Ecology and Management, USA.
    - My current research focuses on integrated modeling for ecosystem services assessments, using a combination of process-based models and genetic optimizations to guide complex decision-making.

2018-2020
    - M.Sc. Ecology and Environmental Management, Liverpool Hope University (Distinction).
    - Thesis Title: *Evaluation of conservation evidence generated by citizen volunteer biological recording efforts: A case study of the common frog and common toad (Bufo bufo) in North Merseyside*.
    - My research used a range of citizen science volunteer data to quantify survey coverage, spatial bias resampling metrics, and proxies for evaluating citizen science volunteer efforts in citizen science data archives. I employed unsupervised machine algorithms and GIS data analytics in R to achieve the intended objectives.
    - Supervisors: Dr. Paul Rooney and Dr. Jennifer Clear.

2011-2016
    - BSc. Conservation Forestry and Products Technology, Makerere University (First Class Honours).
    - Thesis Title: *Species Diversity and Regeneration in an Encroached Forest Peninsula*.
    - This research tested the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, as proposed by Joseph Cornell, to understand how important tree species have regenerated and re-established themselves after historical human disturbance. I stratified the peninsula into heavily disturbed, moderately disturbed, and no disturbance zones and compared the diversity and regeneration along this disturbance gradient. Global Ranosim and a variety of diversity indices were used to analyze this variation.
    - Supervisor: Prof. Edward Nector Mwavu.

2009-2010
    - Uganda Advanced Certificate of Education, Pilkington College Muguluka (20/25 pts).

2004-2006
    - Uganda Certificate of Education, Mt St John's College Kagoma (First Grade).
